      "[{'index': 0, 'time': '06:21:00', 'title': '2 FAANG Stocks to Buy in 2024 and 1 to Avoid', 'content': 'The stock market has soared over the last decade. A $10,000 investment made in a market-tracking fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) at the start of 2014 would be worth $29,673 today after having grown at a compound annual rate of 11.6%, assuming that dividends were reinvested along the way.\\n\\nBut the handful of elite stocks known as the FAANG group has delivered even stronger returns. In the last decade, an equal-weighted and dividend-reinvested portfolio of these five stocks would have grown from $10,000 to $89,051. That\\'s a mind-blowing 24.7% compound annual growth rate. It was a bumpy ride, as the FAANG portfolio outperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracker in five years and underperformed in the other five, but stellar results of 2015, 2020, and 2023 outweighed the weak 2022 period.\\n\\nIn case you\\'re not familiar with FAANG, I\\'m talking about these familiar companies:\\n\\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google.\\n\\nThe mildest 10-year gain among these top-shelf stocks was 400% for Alphabet. At the other end of the scale, Apple led the way with an 867% share price increase. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker is also the only dividend payer of the bunch; reinvesting those payouts would have lifted an investor\\'s total return on Apple stock to a cool 1,000% in 10 years.\\n\\nBut even the members of this exclusive club aren\\'t always indisputable buys. Right now, I see two excellent investment opportunities for 2024 in this bunch, but one that investors should avoid until further notice.\\n\\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 1: Alphabet\\n\\nThe Google parent took a hard fall in 2022. Both of its dual-class stock types fell by as much as 42% as the company was hamstrung by a rickety global economy and a weak digital advertising market. Overall, Alphabet\\'s stock has gone essentially nowhere over the past two years, posting a loss of 3%.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThat said, its formerly stalled growth is back in action now. Alphabet\\'s trailing-12-month sales stand at $297 billion today, up from $258 billion in fiscal year 2021. That\\'s 15% higher, in case you prefer to think in percentages. Free cash flow rose from $67 billion to $78 billion over the same period, a 16% increase.\\n\\nAbove all, Alphabet\\'s future looks bright. The advertising market is coming back from its inflation-induced slump. Google Cloud is a leading provider of cloud-based access to powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and the company even designs its own AI accelerator microchips.\\n\\nSo Alphabet\\'s stock chart has stalled while the business rekindled its fading growth. These days, Alphabet shares can be had at the modest valuations of 27 times trailing earnings and 23 times free cash flows. These readings stand below their long-term averages, and you know Alphabet will stay relevant in the long run. Ergo, this looks like a great time to scoop up some Alphabet shares on the cheap.\\n\\nNo-brainer FAANG buy No. 2: Netflix\\n\\nIf Alphabet took a bruising in 2022, the market took Netflix behind the woodshed for a proper pummeling. The streaming video pioneer\\'s stock dropped by as much as 72% last year, and despite a strong rebound, Netflix still trades 19% below where it ended 2021. After a brief period when its investment theme was horror story, the company looks more like a wholesome family-friendly feature again, and well worth binge-investing in.\\n\\nThe thing is, the big drop it took in 2022 never made sense to me. Investors essentially punished Netflix for doing exactly what they had been hoping it would do -- putting a fresh focus on margins and profitable revenue growth. Management\\'s enhanced desire for profitability came at the cost of slower customer growth, which used to be the most essential figure to watch in each of Netflix\\'s quarterly reports. Old habits die hard, and the market\\'s reaction to Netflix\\'s updated strategy was brutal.\\n\\nNow, Netflix\\'s stock price has approximately tripled from the multiyear low it touched in mid-2021. The most glaringly obvious opportunity to take advantage of the buying window is behind us. Still, Netflix strikes me as a solid buy with reignited growth engines and modest valuation ratios. In particular, Netflix stock is cheaper than ever on a price-to-free-cash-flow basis, which is the exact financial metric the company\\'s critics used to complain about the most.\\n\\nCash flows may dip somewhat in 2024 as Netflix\\'s content production projects get back on track after the writers\\' and actors\\' strikes of 2023, but the long-term trend is clear. Netflix is no longer seeking customers at any cost. Instead, the company is optimizing its cash flows and profits, even at the cost of slower subscriber growth. I\\'m perfectly fine with that switch, and Wall Street as a whole should eventually embrace it as well.\\n\\nUntil then, Netflix remains a no-brainer buy in my book.\\n\\nThe FAANG stock to avoid in 2024: Meta Platforms\\n\\nI\\'m not here to throw Meta Platform under the bus, but the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp just doesn\\'t look like a buy right now.\\n\\nThe company\\'s all-in bet on the metaverse is years away from paying metaphorical dividends. The Reality Labs division\\'s revenues amount to a rounding error in Meta\\'s overall financial structure, clocking in at 0.6% of total sales in the recent third-quarter report. But management is leaning into that potential growth driver with all its might. Those $210 million in third-quarter revenues came at the cost of an operating loss of $3.7 billion for the Reality Labs division.\\n\\nBut the company exceeded Wall Street\\'s earnings expectations in three of this year\\'s four earnings reports and investors see Mark Zuckerberg\\'s business as a promising AI innovator. So the stock has gained 198% in 2023, largely erasing 2022\\'s price drop.\\n\\n\"Wait a minute, Anders,\" I hear you say. \"Isn\\'t this the same story as Alphabet, which experienced similar share price trends and advertising quirks over the last two years? If you like Alphabet, you should love Meta Platforms too.\"\\n\\nWell, I see the similarities, but Meta\\'s situation is dramatically different from Alphabet\\'s. The company formerly known as Facebook may have some AI ideas in its holster, but it can\\'t match Google\\'s decades of AI expertise or the AI-infused heft of the Google Cloud service. And if AI is supposed to save Meta from its low-growth morass, the heavy spending on metaverse projects must be viewed as an expensive distraction.\\n\\nIn sum, Meta Platforms seems like a momentum-powered stock right now, and I\\'m not convinced that AI will be a game-changer for the company. If and when the broader market reaches the same conclusion, Meta\\'s stock could experience a painful price correction. Until then, I\\'d rather keep my hands off this overheated social media stock, even if it is part of the market-beating FAANG group.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn\\'t one of them.

The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) recently climbed to a record high, with the benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gaining 25% and 44%, year to date, through the closing bell on Dec. 28.\\n\\nBut it\\'s not about where Wall Street has been, so much as where the stock market is headed next. If there were such a thing as a perfect forecasting tool, everyone would be using it. Unfortunately, there isn\\'t, which means the best we can do as investors is use a combination of history, macro and company-specific data, and our experience, to make predictions about the future.\\n\\nWhat follows are 10 stock market predictions -- including macro predictions that can have bearing on the performance of equities -- for 2024. Image source: Getty Images.\\n\\n1. The U.S. economy will dip into a recession\\n\\nTo start with, the most-anticipated recession in U.S. history will finally take shape in the new year.\\n\\nThe Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI), which is comprised of 10 inputs and attempts to anticipate turning points in the business cycle, has declined for 19 consecutive months. With the exception of a 22-month decline from 1973-1975 and a 24-month tumble during the Great Depression, we\\'ve never seen a clearer sign that an economic slowdown is expected.\\n\\nFollowing the money also offers a potentially chilling tale for Wall Street, at least in the very short term. Commercial bank credit has declined since mid-February, which signals that banks are purposefully tightening their lending standards.\\n\\nMeanwhile, M2 money supply is notably falling for the first time since the Great Depression. Less available money for transactions has historically been a telltale sign that an economic downturn is on the horizon.\\n\\n2. The bear market returns in 2024\\n\\nAlthough the U.S. economy and stock market aren\\'t tied at the hip, a downturn in the economy tends to have a negative impact on corporate earnings. History tells us that roughly two-thirds of the S&P 500\\'s drawdowns since the start of the Great Depression in September 1929 have occurred after, not prior to, a recession being declared. In other words, if (key word!) a recession was to materialize, a bear market for stocks would probably follow.\\n\\nStory continues S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio Chart\\n\\nSomething else to consider is that stocks aren\\'t cheap. The S&P 500\\'s Shiller price-to-earnings ratio (also known as the \"cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio) ended Dec. 28 at 32.36. That\\'s about 90% higher than its average reading of 17.07, when back-tested 154 years.\\n\\nFurther, there have only been six instances since 1870 where the S&P 500\\'s Shiller P/E surpassed 30. Following the previous five occasions, the broader market went on to lose between 20% and 89% of its value. While the Shiller P/E isn\\'t a timing tool, it does suggest that extended periods of premium valuations aren\\'t well-tolerated by Wall Street.\\n\\n3. The second-longest yield-curve inversion on record will end\\n\\nThe yield curve, which is a chart depicting the yields of various Treasury debt securities relative to their maturity dates, has often been a tell of what\\'s to come for the U.S. economy and stock market.\\n\\nThe US Yield Curve (10-year minus 3-month) has now been inverted for 427 consecutive days, the 2nd longest streak in history. Will likely become the longest inversion ever in February 2024. pic.twitter.com/l1q7cVMwSx\\n\\n-- Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) December 27, 2023\\n\\nFor the past 428 calendar days, as of Dec. 28, the yield curve that compares the 10-year Treasury bond to three-month Treasury bills has been inverted. This is to say that shorter-dated debt securities (i.e., the three-month bill) have higher yields than the longer-dated bond. While a yield-curve inversion doesn\\'t guarantee that a U.S. recession is imminent, every recession since World War II has been preceded by an inversion.\\n\\nThough the current inversion is likely to become the longest on record (currently 469 calendar days, set between Nov. 1965 and March 1967), it\\'s unlikely to persist throughout the new year. With the nation\\'s central bank expected to begin a rate-easing cycle, it wouldn\\'t be surprising for the yield curve to normalize by year\\'s end.\\n\\n4. One of Wall Street\\'s most-hated industries will thrive\\n\\nIf the Treasury yield curve inversion ends in 2024, highly interest-sensitive companies could benefit. This includes one of Wall Street\\'s most universally disliked industries: mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs).\\n\\nPopular mortgage REITs like Annaly Capital Management(NYSE: NLY) and AGNC Investment(NASDAQ: AGNC) make their living by borrowing money at low short-term lending rates and use this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs). The greater the gap between the average yield on owned assets less average borrowing rate (this difference is known as \"net interest margin\"), the more profitable a mortgage REIT can be.\\n\\nThe yield-curve inversion has narrowed the net interest margin for mortgage REITs and made short-term borrowing costlier. But an end to this inversion, coupled with dovish Fed monetary policy, could make Annaly Capital Management and AGNC Investment absolutely sparkle in the eyes of income seekers. Image source: Getty Images.\\n\\n5. Core inflation will remain stubbornly high, if not reaccelerate\\n\\nMost investors are likely thrilled with the Federal Reserve forecasting three rate cuts in 2024. When interest rates decline, it encourages companies to borrow, which can accelerate corporate hiring, fuel acquisition activity, and bolster innovation.\\n\\nBut there\\'s another side to this coin. In recent memory, the Fed has cut rates in response to a growth slowdown. During the third quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis notes that U.S. gross domestic product increased by a red-hot 5.2%. With the nation\\'s central bank planning to reduce rates in 2024, it risks reaccelerating the rate of inflation.\\n\\nThe core inflation rate, which removes volatile food and energy costs from the equation, could be particularly stubborn in 2024. A rapid uptick in mortgage rates has effectively frozen the housing market. Nothing short of a hard landing for the U.S. economy is likely to bring the core inflation down to the Fed\\'s long-term target of 2%.\\n\\n6. The artificial intelligence (AI) bubble will begin to burst\\n\\nOne of the primary catalysts that sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite screaming higher in 2023 is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI, which involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks typically assigned to humans, can add nearly $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, according to researchers at PwC.\\n\\nHowever, history isn\\'t on the side of AI\\'s continued success -- at least in the short run. Every single next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has gone through an initial bubble period. While many of these trends produced big-time winners over the long-term, the internet, business-to-business commerce, genomics, 3D printing, marijuana, blockchain technology, and the metaverse are just some of the examples of highly touted \"new trends\" that weren\\'t initially given enough time to mature.\\n\\nThe potential bubble-popping event for AI could come from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has established itself as the infrastructure backbone of AI-accelerated data centers. Graphics processing unit (GPU) scarcity has sent Nvidia\\'s pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs through the roof in 2023. But as production expands in the new year and competition picks up, Nvidia\\'s pricing power and gross margin appear likely to take a hit.\\n\\n7. Microsoft will surpass Apple to become the most-valuable public company\\n\\nWith few exceptions over the past decade, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been the world\\'s largest publicly traded company by market cap. Apple\\'s innovation has been the driving force behind its success. It remains the leading smartphone company by market share in the U.S., and its subscription services segment is rapidly evolving.\\n\\nBut when examined as a whole, Apple\\'s growth engine has stalled. All of the company\\'s physical products endured sales declines in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023). While a greater than $600 billion share repurchase program since the start of 2013 has helped lift the company\\'s earnings per share, it\\'s no longer the growth story it once was.\\n\\nWith Apple failing to deliver in the growth department, it\\'s Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) that stands ready to ascend to the top of the pedestal. Microsoft Azure accounted for 25% of global cloud infrastructure service spending during the third quarter, according to Canalys. The company is also benefiting from the abundant cash flow of its legacy operations (e.g., Windows and Office), and its steady stream of acquisitions. Microsoft has the necessary catalysts to become the world\\'s most-valuable public company in 2024.\\n\\n8. Tesla will fall below $100 per share\\n\\nKeeping with the theme of Wall Street\\'s most-important and widely owned companies, I fully expect the world\\'s largest electric vehicle (EV) maker by market cap, Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA), to fall below $100 per share in the new year. For context, Tesla shares closed at roughly $253 with one trading day left in 2023.\\n\\nTesla\\'s pricing strategy is a potentially major red flag. During the company\\'s annual shareholder meeting in May, CEO Elon Musk noted that Tesla\\'s pricing strategy is based on demand. With the company slashing prices on Model\\'s 3, S, X, and Y on more than a half-dozen occasions in 2023, it pretty clearly signals that demand is faltering, inventory levels are rising, and competition is picking up. Tesla\\'s once superior operating margin is now on-par with the auto industry average.\\n\\nFurthermore, Elon Musk continues to be a tangible risk for Tesla\\'s shareholders. Despite being a visionary, he frequently overpromises and underdelivers when it comes to new innovations. Though Tesla is valued as a do-it-all company in the energy and auto space, it generates the bulk of its profit from selling and leasing EVs (the auto industry usually sports single-digit earnings multiples), and is reliant on unsustainable sources of income for a sizable percentage of its profit. ^SPXUS Chart\\n\\n9. Utilities will be a top-3 sector in 2024\\n\\nNext up is the prognostication that the worst-performing sector for the S&P 500 in 2023 will be one of the three best-performing sectors in the new year. I\\'m talking about utilities.\\n\\nMost investors flock to utility stocks because of their low volatility, market-topping dividends, and predictable operating performance. But with Treasury yields soaring in response to the Fed\\'s aggressive rate-hiking cycle, investors bid adieu to utilities and opted to purchase Treasury bonds instead. This led to a very poor year for a traditionally safe sector.\\n\\nBut with the central bank looking to ease interest rates in 2024, utilities are back on the radar as a potential outperformer. The dividend yields of utilities should become more attractive as Treasury bond yields decline. Further, access to cheaper borrowing rates may fuel acquisitions and major projects that ultimately lift growth rates for the sector\\'s major players -- I\\'m looking at you, NextEra Energy.\\n\\n10. A short-lived \"crisis\" will take shape\\n\\nLast but not least is the prediction that an unforeseen event will, at least temporarily, weigh down Wall Street.\\n\\nAlmost every year features an unexpected event that wreaks havoc on the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. For instance, 2023 saw the short-lived regional banking crisis threaten the fabric of the financial system. The failure of three sizable banks created ripples throughout the financial sector that had investors questioning the solvency of rock-solid banking institutions.\\n\\nIn 2022, Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine served as the year\\'s tumultuous event. The geopolitical implications of Russia\\'s invasion led to a short-term malaise for equities.\\n\\nThough it\\'s impossible to predict what short-term crisis might unfold in 2024, the best guess I can offer is a housing price collapse, or perhaps a wave of auto loan defaults.\\n\\nOnly time will tell if this or any of these predictions comes to fruition in the new year.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn\\'t one of them.

The worst performer in the group, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), rose 49%, and the best, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), jumped nearly 240%. But with such strong runs behind them, do any of them have room left to grow in 2024?\\n\\nThe answer: Yes, and some are still worth buying at their current prices.\\n\\nApple and Nvidia are both richly valued for their performance\\n\\nI\\'m breaking the seven up into buy, sell, and hold groups. Starting with the sell set, I think Apple and Nvidia\\'s stock prices far outpaced their businesses.\\n\\nNvidia\\'s 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, and its business has responded in kind. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), revenue rose 206% year over year. Furthermore, management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue, up 231%. The stock\\'s movement was warranted given the company\\'s sales growth, but I\\'m concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry.\\n\\nNvidia goes through boom and bust cycles, and right now is certainly a boom. However, it\\'s unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term. If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly, the stock may come crashing back down to earth. Plus, it\\'s trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium.\\n\\nFrom a business standpoint, Apple is the opposite of Nvidia. Its sales declined throughout 2023. Even so, its stock skyrocketed. This makes little sense, and more headwinds are coming up: a U.S. International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume). With all this in mind, 2024 could be a tough year for the company. And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than \"Magnificent Seven\" members Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), it doesn\\'t make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMicrosoft and Tesla need to show me some results\\n\\nI view Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) as holds currently. Microsoft had a strong year, as its revenues and earnings per share (EPS) steadily rose. However, Microsoft trades at a steep premium, even on a forward earnings basis. MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts.\\n\\nMicrosoft is executing well, but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying. Still, it\\'s far from a sell.\\n\\nTesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street, as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products. It\\'s also set to face some added headwinds. Starting in 2024, some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit due to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them.\\n\\nWhen judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock, I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends. For Tesla, these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022. TSLA PE Ratio Chart\\n\\nI\\'m taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesn\\'t look like a bargain at these prices.\\n\\nAdvertising should bounce back in 2024\\n\\nThat leaves Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in the buy now category. These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year.\\n\\nEven though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments, they are mostly advertising businesses. In 2022 and 2023, the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming. However, now that we have lapped that pullback, Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses. Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24%, respectively, in Q3.\\n\\nNext year should be another strong recovery year for advertising, which will boost both companies.\\n\\nAmazon has also had a strong 2023, with its margins rising. AMZN Gross Profit Margin Chart\\n\\nHowever, this chart doesn\\'t tell the full story, as this takes into account Amazon\\'s profits over the past 12 months. If you focus on its latest quarterly results, Amazon\\'s margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\\n\\nThe fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4, which is usually its strongest one. No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, but 2024 could give us a glimpse, making it a strong buy now.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn\\'t one of them.

Avoid the Others.', 'content': 'Any investing exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks has made your 2023 investing year a big success. This group of mega-cap tech stocks, including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), has outperformed the broader market despite the Nasdaq Composite surging over 45% last year.\\n\\nIf it\\'s not broken, don\\'t fix it... right? Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023.\\n\\n1. Nvidia: Buy\\n\\nNvidia\\'s chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That\\'s pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion. NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\\n\\nAI demand doesn\\'t seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company\\'s earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia\\'s valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That\\'s a PEG ratio of just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023.\\n\\n2. Apple: Avoid\\n\\nNot every \"Magnificent Seven\" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple\\'s revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple\\'s business can be cyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That\\'s fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\\n\\nAnalysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n3. Meta Platforms: Buy\\n\\nWall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business, harmful privacy changes to iPhones, and expensive metaverse projects that weren\\'t showing any return on investment. Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs, working through the iPhone challenges, and getting revenue growth and profits back on track. META PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\\n\\nAstonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta is still a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond.\\n\\n4. Microsoft: Avoid\\n\\nChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world\\'s largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\\n\\nMid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it\\'s becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillion market cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock\\'s resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn\\'t as appealing as some other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\\n\\nIt\\'s not abhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop, there are better deals out there. It\\'s OK for investors to be picky.\\n\\n5. Amazon: Buy\\n\\nInterestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\\n\\nOver the past decade, that\\'s over 20% below Amazon\\'s average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing in developing its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That\\'s not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail).\\n\\n6. Tesla: Avoid\\n\\nElectric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It\\'s a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla\\'s operating results. Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year. TSLA PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\\n\\nHopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it\\'s striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla\\'s future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla\\'s stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy.\\n\\n7. Alphabet: Buy\\n\\nAlphabet\\'s dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world\\'s most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\\n\\nThe company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock\\'s 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn\\'t one of them.

The Dividend Aristocrat stock has a dividend payout history, as it has hiked its annual dividend payouts for 61 consecutive years.\\n\\nDespite the volatile market backdrop, Coca-Cola is expected to maintain stable growth momentum, as the company\\'s revenue is expected to rise by 4.1% in the quarter ending December. The consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $0.48 for the quarter ending in December indicates a 6.7% year-over-year increase.\\n\\nBank of America\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway owns approximately 1.03 billion shares of Bank of America Corp.

Analysts forecast that, broadly, 2024 will mark a record year for revenue while the industry prepares to double within the next decade, generating a trillion dollars in revenue between now and then.\\n\\nThat means, of course, that you don’t have to be the Warren Buffett of semiconductor stocks to ride the wave upward. If you find reliable, well-known, stable semiconductor stocks and hold them for the long haul, you’ll likely do just fine. But there are hundreds of hidden semiconductor stocks out there. If you can effectively forecast some of the less-recognized trends and then pin down the best stocks in the sector to capitalize on the trend, you could easily outperform the broader sector.\\n\\nRecovery and Rebound in 2024\\n\\nThough semiconductors remained top-of-mind for many investors, the sector itself struggled this year. Widespread demand for the most advanced semiconductors isn’t there yet, while middle-market products aren’t sufficiently profitable to drive solid margins. Expect 2023 to mark a sector-wide 12% sales decline once the dust settles.\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\n\\nBut winds could be shifting. On the heels of slackened demand, many companies cut production and exhausted existing inventory. That series of strategies seems as though it’ll cause a bullwhip effect as increased demand outpaces inventory and production capability.\\n\\nAnalysts expect that continued AI developments and renewed consumer confidence leading to more tech purchasing will spark a 20% annual growth rate in 2024. Ultimately, that will benefit semiconductor stocks globally, so investing in a solid manufacturer with this in mind could prove profitable, even if you don’t have the expertise to truly pick the best-in-class semiconductor stock.\\n\\nStock to watch:Onto Innovation (NYSE:ONTO), which offers testing and quality control solutions for semiconductor stocks – meaning it benefits no matter which company comes out on top.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDriver Assistance and Infotainment\\n\\nThough not the largest semiconductor market segment (edged out by data processing, of course), the automotive sector’s semiconductor demand is growing the fastest. That segment is set to hit 10.3% CAGR by 2025. And, within the rapidly growing segment, driver assistance, safety and infotainment systems are the most chip-hungry subcomponents.\\n\\nSemiconductors power most vehicular functions today, but increased vehicle “smartness” across legacy and electric segments demands greater semiconductor sourcing. Anti-lock brake systems, airbag management, air conditioning and more all rely on semiconductors like never before. That’s part of what drove the record used car sales throughout the pandemic. New manufacturers, reliant on semiconductors, got hamstrung by global supply chain slowdowns and drove astronomic used car pricing. And that’s without addressing self-driving vehicles. Those systems have a suite of safety features and detection systems that — you guessed it — need a slew of semiconductors.\\n\\nBut semiconductors benefit even the most basic makes and models, as advances in dashboard infotainment (think CarPlay) are prevalent in even economy models. Infotainment expansion could hit 38% growth through 2023, making it a top semiconductor trend to watch.\\n\\nStock to watch: Infineon (OTCMKTS:IFNNY), which specializes in EV and infotainment semiconductor manufacturing.\\n\\nAI in Your Pocket\\n\\nAI runs on massive amounts of data processing demands, which rely on massive data centers driven by semiconductors. But just as the earliest computers took up entire university halls before shrinking to pocket size, advanced AI applications will shrink to accommodate smaller and more efficient hardware.\\n\\nMost of that push towards personal AI will be driven by advances in semiconductors and similar tech more than coding or software. The best AI assistant is useless if the hardware won’t support its mobility and lifestyle integration, so stocks pushing to make better chips smaller will be at the forefront of personal AI. Just like today’s mega-stocks were at the fore of personal computing trends, companies able to adapt hardware to suit personal AI applications will be tomorrow’s Magnificent 7 — or bigger.\\n\\nAt the same time, there is an increased preference for even “dumb(ish)” wearables and fitness tracking tech. These, too, need shrunken semiconductors to effectively integrate wearables with peripheral tech like phones and monitoring systems.\\n\\nStock to watch: Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), whose partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) puts it at the leading edge of pocket-sized semiconductor applications.\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nThere’s no doubt that, like many emergent tech trends, semiconductor development isn’t environmentally friendly. Semiconductor production demands energy and water in spades while offloading significant greenhouse gasses. A growing environmental impact, alongside indications that tech is hurting the environment through energy usage more than it’s helping through innovation, is kickstarting calls for transparency and climate action within semiconductor companies.\\n\\nLooking ahead, 2024 and beyond will likely mark a turning point where more semiconductor companies embrace comprehensive sustainability strategies to keep regulatory bodies and consumers happy. But shifting towards sustainability makes business sense, too. Implementing water recycling and renewable energy use helps address direct and supply chain emissions and leads to reduced operating costs. This dual benefit of environmental responsibility and improved financial positioning makes sustainability another top semiconductor trend.\\n\\nStock to watch: ASM International (OTCMKTS:ASMIY), a Dutch firm recognized as the first semiconductor stock to validate a net-zero path.\\n\\nMegaplant and Foundry Industry Expansion\\n\\nAs countries realize the advantage of geographically centralized manufacturing when supply chains slow, expect greater demand for in-house semiconductor plants and foundry development. Though little has come to fruition yet, we’re already seeing the US CHIPS and Science Act push toward semiconductor independence at home.\\n\\nAt the same time, Japan acts as a model of what prudent positioning looks like. The country is allocating $10 billion toward semiconductor projects, including a second massive Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSMC) plant. At the same time, Japan ensures that TSMC’s expert teams educate internal scientists and researchers to diversify its knowledge base. That’s evident from the collaboration between TSMC and Japan’s own private semiconductor company, Rapidus Corp.\\n\\nUltimately, Japan stands as a model for national semiconductor industrial expansion by ensuring facility growth remains matched with growing the knowledge base and national brainpower. Hopefully, the US CHIPS Act’s lofty promises will come to fruition, and we, too, can stake a future on independent semiconductor development.\\n\\nStock to watch: Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSMC).\\n\\nChina Fights for Dominance\\n\\nOf course, a major geopolitical sticking point within the semiconductor industry is China. Not only does tension put pressure on the Taiwanese top semiconductor stock, TSMC, but the nation is offering cut-rate price competition in a bid to squeeze other national competitors from the market. Most of that price push comes amid US sanctions that prevent sales to major Western powers, forcing China to make ends meet where it can.\\n\\nBut, internally, China’s 5G proliferation and Huawei expansion mean the country is increasingly competitive as market forces push for greater innovation. Sanctions mean China’s AI capabilities lag ours as they’re cut off from business with the most advanced manufacturer, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Still, internal advancements continue unabated, and it might be a matter of time until China is as competitive as Nvidia on the national front — especially if they squeeze out competition through cost leadership plays.\\n\\nTech Talent\\n\\nTalent management remains top-of-mind within the industry, making companies able to snag the best performers more competitive than their peers. Expect semiconductor companies to dip into global markets more often as at-home talent becomes exhausted. This, of course, presents a double-edged sword. While snagging top talent improves operational outcomes, it comes at a cost — both in compensation and continued training — so fierce competition for a shrinking talent pool could just as likely cause share price troubles.\\n\\nExpect to see top semiconductor stocks start fostering community development to nurture future talent pools. That could include sponsoring STEM competitions or offering scholarships to talented students. In any case, competition is fierce within the semiconductor sector, and talent acquisition isn’t an exception.\\n\\nStock to watch: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because name recognition and the top-performing semiconductor spot both go a long way toward attracting top talent.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Joby Aviation continues to demonstrate the volume potential of its operations at airports. Joby recently demonstrated that it would be possible to operate 120 flights per hour in and out of busy airports.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nLithium Americas (LAC) Person holding smartphone with logo of Canadian company Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) on screen in front of website Focus on phone display.\\n\\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nLithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Is another stock to consider that leverages the drastic changes occurring across the field of mobility. Electric vehicles continue to displace internal combustion engine vehicles although their growth has not been linear. I am, of course, referring to the recent collapse in lithium prices and EV sales.\\n\\nIn short, the electrification of vehicles is not going to stop. EV adoption is still relatively early overall but investors should rest assured the industry is not dying. Lithium did however face a steep price correction in 2023 that saw prices decline by 80%. However with every decline there is always a chance of rebound. Current expectations are that the rebound in lithium prices will begin either in 2024 or perhaps 2025.\\n\\nThat coincides quite well with Lithium Americas and its future production plans. The company owns the rights to Thacker Pass which is the largest lithium deposit in the Western hemisphere. Lithium Americas commenced construction in June of this year and anticipates lithium mining operations to start sometime in 2026. It isn’t hyperbolic to suggest that investing in Lithium Americas could produce 10x returns.\\n\\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\\n\\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) could pop up on any megatrend stock list for a number of reasons. The company is intimately connected with all things technological being that it is the leading producer of the most in-demand chips. Primarily though, Nvidia promises to provide a strong start to 2024 because of artificial intelligence.\\n\\nOf course, artificial intelligence is a megatrend that has taken off in 2023. Its rapid emergence has turned Nvidia into\\xa0an even more important company. As strong as Nvidia’s performance has been in 2023, 2024 appears to be just as strong. The analysts covering Nvidia’s shares anticipate that prices could rise by 50% again, if not more.\\n\\nNvidia has cornered the market for AI chips and demand for its h100 chips has been staggering. That said, the company is expected to launch its updated h200 chips in 2024 that promise to further consolidate its lead over the AI field.\\n\\nAMD (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\\n\\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nAMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has to be the other stock to consider in relation to the artificial intelligence megatrend. While the company continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia, it has emerged as a legitimate competitor.\\n\\nBack in mid-November the company announced an event to introduce its MI300 GPU accelerator. Then, weeks later, in early December the company released the new chips which will be available in 2024. The news has sent AMD shares from just below $100 to nearly $150 as I write this.\\n\\nIt has become clear that major companies are very interested in AMD’s chips for their application to artificial intelligence. Major purchasers including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have noted that they are willing to switch from Nvidia’s h100 chips to AMD’s mi300 chips once they are available. The news is a clear indication that major tech firms believe in AMD and are also frustrated with Nvidia for its pricing. Overall though, it’s a strong indication that AMD is going to remain as a potent challenger in the AI conversation.\\n\\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\\n\\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is another important tech company that touches on many of the megatrends of the near future. The stock is a wise choice for many reasons including its stability and dividend as well as its relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\\n\\nFor the purposes of this conversation though, I’ll be talking about Qualcomm in relation to its 5G business. 5G is one of the mega trends that has emerged over the past few years. It promises to rapidly increase the speed of communication and the degree of connectivity. The push toward greater and greater connectivity is not going to slow and it is estimated that $20,000 satellites will be launched this decade in order to facilitate that increased connectivity.\\n\\nQualcomm notes that 5G is imperative for the Continue development of the digital economy. In fact, the company believes that the overall value associated with 5G will exceed $13 trillion by 2035.\\n\\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\\n\\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\\n\\nIBM (NYSE:IBM) Has emerged as the company that is most closely associated with the development of quantum computing. Quantum computing is a nascent technology that promises to fundamentally change computing overall. The field leverages quantum mechanics to solve problems that are too complex for current classical computers to solve.\\n\\nQuantum computing is an incredibly complex field and those who would like to learn more about it should do so through this link.\\n\\nThe important thing to understand for the layman investor like myself is that IBM is the leader in quantum computing. Thus, if any company is best positioned to take advantage of this megatrend, IBM is it.\\n\\nIBM’s industry-best qubit count is expected to\\xa0more than quadruple by 2025. The company is developing quantum computing hardware as well as software including the cloud-based quantum computing services. If quantum computing lives up to its billing then IBM can grow rapidly. For now, current investors can get a dividend that yields more than 4% making IBM shares attractive for income investors and those looking for future growth.\\n\\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\\n\\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\\n\\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) often enters discussions that relate to e-commerce and fintech stocks. It’s probably the clearest example of a company that is showing strong results in both regards. The company has emerged as the dominant force in Latin American e-commerce and created a strong, rapidly growing payments platform in the process.\\n\\nMercadoLibre’s results in that regard are incredibly impressive. During the third quarter, revenues increased by more than 69%, reaching $3.8 billion. Meanwhile, gross payment volume grew by 121% to $47.3 billion. And while Mercado Libre deserves recognition for those results, there are other\\xa0megatrends that I want to focus on.\\n\\nInstead, it is the megatrend of emerging markets. Economists continue to note that emerging markets have vast untapped potential. World superpowers including the United States and China face significant problems which has led investors to look at emerging markets with a greater focus. Thus, firms like MercadoLibre are well positioned due to their exposure to the emerging market trend as well as those in fintech and commerce.\\n\\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
